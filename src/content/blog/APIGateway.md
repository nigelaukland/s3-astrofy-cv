Simple demonstration of API Gateway. The only coding involved was a Python function running on AWS Lambda which is responsible for forming the JSON payload response.

Steps involved:

1. Creation of an API Gateway with two routes:
    * Root: `"GET /"` - this returns a simple text response as JSON
    * Second: `"GET /things"` - this returns a response describing the *API stage* and *Lambda alias* responsible for the response 

2. Creation of three Lambda aliases and three corresponding API *stages*:
    * Lambda alias *PROD* pointing to a stable production version of the Lambda function whose task it is to form the response.
    * Lambda alias *STAGE* pointing to a test version of the Lambda function which might be used for blue/green deployments or canary testing.
    * Lambda alias *$LATEST* corresponding to the latest version of the Lambda function, used for development.

3. Creation of three API stages which can be used to manage concurrent versions of the API, along with managed deployments:
    * PROD
    * STAGE
    * DEV

4. Creation of a *custom domain name* to replace the provided API Gateway URL with something more meaningful and understandable. (https://api.nigelaukland.com)
    * Along with an *API mapping* for the API stages: 
      * https://api.nigelaukland.com/things (PROD, no additional path)
      * https://api.nigelaukland.com/STAGE/things
      * https://api.nigelaukland.com/DEV/things

5. And lastly a configuration of Route53 to map the domain `api.nigelaukland.com` to the API Gateway provided gateway URL.
