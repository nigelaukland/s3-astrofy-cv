In this scenario Elastic Beanstalk has been used for two purposes. Firstly to take control of the instrastructue aspects. Secondly to manage the versioning and deployment of a simple demo web application (node.js backend). 

1. Infrastructure
* S3 storage for the code distributions
* Security groups for appropriate communication between services
* Elastic IP for public access
* EC2 instances to host and run the application code
* Auto scaling group for scale-out (and used for deployments)

2. Versioning and deployment
* For an application `nigelaukland-eb-1`, two enironments: 
  
  * `nigelaukland-eb-1-dev`: Dev environment running v2.1 (blue)
  * ðŸ”— http://eb-dev.nigelaukland.com (http only)
  
  * `nigelaukland-eb-1-prod2`: Prod environent running v2.2 (green)
  * ðŸ”— https://eb-prod.nigelaukland.com  
* New application versions have been deployed using traffic splitting to direct a proportion of traffic to newly instantiated hosts running the new version. Then terminating the original instances once the health checks are passed.
